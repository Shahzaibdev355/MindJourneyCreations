						<p class="heading-faq">
							Tell us about the Brave Whistler. What inspired you to write it and what do you like most
							about it?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> Like many
							of my stories, it started out as a bedtime story for my own children. The inspiration from
							this book actually came from another children's book called the Quiltmaker's Gift. One night
							when telling a story, I guess that story was somewhat fresh in mind, and out of it came this
							conflict between a man who just had to whistle and a king who was no nonsense and
							authoritarian. It's been a theme of my own life to do my own thing, what I feel inspired to
							do, and it's something I think we should all stand up for in ourselves.

						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="page-2" class="page bg-light two">

						<p class="heading-faq">
							So did the king remind you of someone in your own life?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> Yes and no.
							There wasn't say a single person but more of a type of person who maybe means well but only
							sees things his or her way. So this inspired a point of conflict that I think most of us can
							see around us. This struggle between those that think they know best and want the world to
							be ordered a certain way and the free thinkers and dreamers who see so many other ways to do
							it. And it was out of that dynamic that the Whistler and the King's conflict arose and
							ultimately resolved. In the end, it's not just about the Whistler being who he is, but the
							King ultimately seeing that the world can and does work in different ways. And power itself
							has its limits.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-3" class="page bg-light three">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							Great points. In terms of power, what are the lessons here?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> Power is
							always given. In this case, the King's power comes from his ability to govern the people and
							keep the kingdom together, to make sure they have enough food to go through the year. Like
							many people, especially those who are used to having power, there is always the threat of
							losing it, and what the consequences of that are. The King fears everything will go to ruin.
							And of course, he maybe does not like the idea of personally losing power. It is part of his
							identity. So when that power is challenged, it is a big deal, and he will use that power to
							keep it. But that is usually when things go wrong, when that power is pushed too far, the
							people who accept that power may relinquish it. So the Whistler as a rebel or a voice for
							the rebel is important, as he shows the path for a better way not just for the people to
							stand up for themselves, but for those with power to use it wisely.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-4" class="page bg-light four">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							Do you think there should ultimately be no rulers or powerful people?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> The book
							really is not about that. In this case, the King discovers that there is a greater power
							than his own laws and ability to enforce them. There is a place for power. It's not a matter
							of whether a person or small group will be in power - human nature and history show that we
							tend towards some concentration of power. The question is how that power is used, do those
							in authority see their role as serving the people and the greater good or being served by
							the people? Do those with power recognize and support the hopes and dreams of those whom
							they lead, or do they see the people as automatons and incapable of self-direction? We see
							that here with the king - when he clings more to his authority than his mission to help the
							people unlock their potential, they withdraw their participation and he loses that power.
							Once he realizes that purpose again, then a new equilibrium is reached and a healthy power
							dynamic is restored.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-5" class="page bg-light five">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							There seem to be some other themes in the book besides just power. Can you talk about that a
							little bit here?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> Absolutely.
							Like most of my stories and writing, there tend to be layers and interconnected points.
							Often I do not see them all myself until they are written out. There is the Whistler
							himself, who is really trying to find that thing he is best at. The first few pages capture
							that. He is not content just following the path that society might have set out for him, the
							traditional job path. He can do those things, and when he does, he is good at them. But it
							is his love of nature and whistling that really bring the world to life for him. That is a
							very relatable concept, one that strikes a chord with me. One thing I would love to see is
							someone reading this tale to their child and having an epiphany of something like, oh I
							always wanted to make my own ice cream and sell it, and I know people love it. Why not? Take
							that risk and follow that dream.For children at an early age to think that yes, I will
							have a job someday, but what's really my place in the world.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-6" class="page bg-light six">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							That by itself seems like a big theme. I cannot help but think about the connection to
							nature and the role the wind plays.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> Oh yes,
							that is a big one. The wind, of course, is part of nature. It can be felt, and is only seen
							by what it does and the effects it creates. So too with Whistling and the Whistler. When the
							story starts out, people do not see a connection between the wind and whistling, its song or
							other nature. It's just there as wind, taken for granted. This is something the Whistler
							really connects to and he becomes bigger than himself, as he is a messenger for something
							greater.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-7" class="page bg-light seven">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							On that topic, what role does religion play in this story?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> For me
							personally, faith is important. I do believe in God, in something higher than myself. What I
							like about this story, what I wanted to convey was there is something special that is
							greater than ourselves that anyone can relate to regardless of their belief system. I have
							been asked, &ldquo;why is Love capitalized?&rdquo; To me, God is Love - that's part of my theology.
							Love is universal, it transcends religion, and it something that we should all be able to
							agree gives life meaning.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="page-8" class="page bg-light eight">
						<p class="heading-faq">
							What is the future of the Whistler?
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #263b5e;">Kendig:</span> It is
							really on the wind to know where he will be next.

										<h2>FLOATING TALKING PUMPKIN HEAD - EXPECTED FALL 2023</h2>
										<p>
											Bud looked out the window and Terri looked out the door. They saw nothing.
											<br>
											They both stood looking and waiting. <br>
											The laughter came again, louder. And then a knock. <br>
											Bud opened the front door and looked all around. No one was there. <br>
											Then he looked up. And he screamed. <br>
											"Hahahahahahahaha!" the voice shouted out. <br>
											"I am the Floating, Talking Pumpkin Head! You cannot escape me!" Terri ran
											out and saw nothing. Then she looked up
											to see the pumpkin head floating in the air, shaking as it laughed. <br>
											Then it fell on her head. <br>
											"Ahhhhhhhahhhhhhh! Get it off me!" she screamed. <br>
											Bud screamed too. Meanwhile, the pumpkin head kept laughing in its creepy
											voice. <br>
											Then Bud grabbed the pumpkin head off Terri's head…
										</p>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h2>SKELETON PARTY - EXPECTED 2024</h2>
										<p>
											"I'm scared," said Terri. <br>
											"We're almost there," said Bud. "Nothing to be afraid-" <br>
											Bud was cut off by a scratching and banging noise, like something shifting
											below. Then the ground beneath them
											moved! Two sets of bony hands poked out of the ground and grabbed their
											ankles! Bud and Terri screamed together as
											the skeleton hands pulled them down into the dirt. <br>
											When they landed on the floor, they looked around and saw they were in a
											rather large area and they were not alone.
											They were surrounded by…skeletons! In the corner, a band of skeletons was
											banging and scraping bones and skulls
											together. They were playing music! Another troupe was in the middle of the
											room, jumping and moving around to the
											music. They were dancing! "Welcome!" several skeletons said together. <br>
											"Is this a...?" Bud started to ask. <br>
											"Skeleton party?" Terri finished. <br>
											"What else would it be?" a skeleton in a top hat and fancy shoes said to
											them. "Of course, please join the fun."
										</p>
									</div>

									<div class="">

										<h2 class="">Fart Ghost - Expected 2024</h2>
										<p>A small tree branch fell from the wind, and branches scratched against the
											windows. <br>
											"What was that?" Terri screeched. <br>
											Bud looked up from the book he was reading and said hesitantly, "I
											think it's just the wind, maybe?" Terri said, "I hope so, but it sounds
											weird." <br>
											Bud listened for a moment and they both looked at each other as they heard
											another sound. <br>
											"Ooooooooooooooo…aaaaahhhh…..ooooooooooooooooooo". <br>
											"I've never heard the wind do that before," Terri said, trembling.<br>
											Bud tried to look calm, but his voice cracked a little when he said, "It is
											pretty windy today."<br>
											"It's windy alright," Terri said, crinkling her nose. <br>
											Then something bumped into the door. Bud got up to look at what it was, and
											Terri followed sheepishly
											behind him.<br>
											"That's strange," Bud said. <br>
											A large brown paper bag floated just at eye level through the window, and
											bumped into the window.<br>
											The noise came again, much louder, "Oooooooooooooooooooo.
											Ahhahahahaha…oooooooooooooooooo."<br>
											Terri cried out, "Ghost!"<br>
											They both jumped and stumbled over each other as they backed away from the
											window.<br>
											Bud sniffed and put his shirt over his nose.<br>
											"Do you smell that?" he asked Terri. "It's awful!"<br>
											Terri wrinkled up her nose and pulled her shirt over her face to block the
											stench.<br>
											"Ugghh! What is that?!" Terri asked in disgust.<br>
											"Hahahahahaha! That's me! Plplplplppppppp!"<br>
											"Oooooh!" Bud and Terri said together. They shook their heads to try and
											clear the smell.<br>
											"I am the most terrifying thing you
											will ever see! I am the….FART Ghost!"
